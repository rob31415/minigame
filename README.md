# minigame

 this is a minigame
 it looks like this, for example:
   5   1   0   -3
   1   1   0   -4
 first row is computer numbers, changing randomly
 second row is controlled by player
 keys Q and W, de- and increase 1st value
 E&R 2nd, U&I 3rd, O&P 4th
 
 a game lasts a few seconds in which the player
 has to match the first line of numbers as close as possible

 at the end, a "rapport" percentage is displayed

 my best was 92.5%

 this is just a little feasibility study for testing out and finetuning timing, mechanics etc.
 the purpose is to find an appealing minigame to embed the idea as one small element
 in a bigger game. maybe as dialog minigame in an adventure or rpc game to make
 it challenging for a player to unlock some dialog options.
